# Requirements Document

## Introduction

DigiPal is a digital pet application that serves as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server with a Gradio web interface. The application combines virtual pet care mechanics inspired by Digimon World 1 with modern AI capabilities, featuring a Qwen3-0.6B communication layer and Kyutai for speech recognition. Users can raise, care for, and interact with their digital companion through various life stages, with each DigiPal having unique attributes that evolve over time and can be passed down through generations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate with Hugging Face so that I can access the DigiPal application and save my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a game-style login interface on the first tab
2. WHEN the user enters valid Hugging Face credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate and proceed to the main application
3. WHEN the user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry
4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL store the session for future use

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a returning user, I want my existing DigiPal to be automatically loaded so that I can continue caring for my digital pet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user has an existing DigiPal THEN the system SHALL automatically load their DigiPal data
2. WHEN loading an existing DigiPal THEN the system SHALL restore all attributes, current life stage, and memory
3. WHEN no existing DigiPal is found THEN the system SHALL proceed to the egg selection interface

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to choose from different colored eggs so that I can start my DigiPal journey with my preferred attributes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user has no existing DigiPal THEN the system SHALL display three egg options: red, blue, and green
2. WHEN the user selects the red egg THEN the system SHALL create a fire-oriented DigiPal with higher attack attributes
3. WHEN the user selects the blue egg THEN the system SHALL create a water-oriented DigiPal with higher defense attributes
4. WHEN the user selects the green egg THEN the system SHALL create an earth-oriented DigiPal with higher health and symbiosis attributes
5. WHEN an egg is selected THEN the system SHALL initialize the DigiPal with base attributes according to the chosen type

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my DigiPal egg to hatch when I first speak to it so that the bonding experience begins naturally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user speaks their first word to the ear interface THEN the system SHALL trigger the hatching process
2. WHEN the egg hatches THEN the system SHALL generate a 2D baby DigiPal image based on predefined prompts and attributes
3. WHEN hatching occurs THEN the system SHALL set the DigiPal to baby life stage with basic command understanding

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to communicate with my DigiPal through speech so that I can interact naturally with my digital pet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user speaks to the ear interface THEN the system SHALL process the audio using Kyutai listener
2. WHEN speech is processed THEN the system SHALL interpret commands and respond using the Qwen3-0.6B model
3. WHEN the DigiPal responds THEN the system SHALL output text-based communication from the model
4. WHEN the DigiPal is in baby stage THEN the system SHALL only understand basic commands: "eat", "sleep", "good", "bad"

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my DigiPal to evolve through different life stages so that I can experience long-term growth and development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a defined time period passes THEN the system SHALL evolve the DigiPal to the next life stage
2. WHEN evolution occurs THEN the system SHALL progress through stages: baby → child → teen → young adult → adult → elderly
3. WHEN evolving THEN the system SHALL update the DigiPal's 2D image to reflect the new life stage
4. WHEN evolving THEN the system SHALL expand command understanding and capabilities based on the new stage

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to perform care actions on my DigiPal so that I can maintain its health and happiness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user performs training actions THEN the system SHALL modify attributes according to Digimon World 1 mechanics
2. WHEN the user feeds the DigiPal THEN the system SHALL affect weight, happiness, and energy based on food type
3. WHEN the user praises or scolds THEN the system SHALL adjust happiness and discipline accordingly
4. WHEN the user lets the DigiPal rest THEN the system SHALL restore energy and affect happiness based on timing
5. WHEN care mistakes occur THEN the system SHALL track them and influence evolution paths

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want my DigiPal to have persistent attributes that affect its behavior so that each pet feels unique and meaningful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a DigiPal is created THEN the system SHALL initialize primary attributes: HP, MP, Offense, Defense, Speed, Brains
2. WHEN a DigiPal is created THEN the system SHALL initialize secondary attributes: Discipline, Happiness, Weight, Care Mistakes
3. WHEN attributes change THEN the system SHALL affect DigiPal behavior, evolution paths, and battle performance
4. WHEN attributes are modified THEN the system SHALL persist changes to storage

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want my elderly DigiPal to pass on traits to a new generation so that I can continue the experience with inherited characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a DigiPal reaches elderly stage and dies THEN the system SHALL provide a new egg with inherited DNA
2. WHEN DNA is inherited THEN the system SHALL pass down modified attributes based on the previous DigiPal's final stats
3. WHEN inheritance occurs THEN the system SHALL apply evolution bonuses (e.g., high HP parent creates high HP offspring)
4. WHEN a new generation begins THEN the system SHALL maintain some randomization while preserving key inherited traits

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to serve as an MCP server so that it can integrate with other AI systems and tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize as a functional MCP server
2. WHEN MCP requests are received THEN the system SHALL handle them according to MCP protocol specifications
3. WHEN serving MCP requests THEN the system SHALL provide access to DigiPal state and interaction capabilities
4. WHEN integrated with other systems THEN the system SHALL maintain DigiPal functionality while serving MCP requests

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a user, I want my DigiPal to have memory so that our interactions feel continuous and meaningful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user interacts with the DigiPal THEN the system SHALL store interaction history in memory
2. WHEN the DigiPal responds THEN the system SHALL reference previous interactions to maintain context
3. WHEN the application restarts THEN the system SHALL restore DigiPal memory from persistent storage
4. WHEN memory becomes too large THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate memory management strategies
